                On April 15, much of the world watched in horror as fire raged at Notre-Dame de Paris in France, destroying the spire and most of the roof of the beloved 850-year-old cathedral. A subsequent investigation found no evidence that the fire was a deliberate act and suggested that it may have been the result of ongoing renovation work at the cathedral.

                 On May 25, George Floyd was arrested by police in Minneapolis for allegedly using a counterfeit bill. Video footage showed one of the officers kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he was pinned on the ground, saying over and over that he couldn’t breathe. In the weeks that followed, outrage over Floyd’s murder and support for the Black Lives Matter movement fueled mass protests against systemic racism and police violence in more than 2,000 U.S. cities and 60 countries around the globe.

                Launched in late July 2020, the NASA rover Perseverance spent months traveling through space, covering some 292.5 million miles before touching down on Mars on February 18. As the space agency’s most sophisticated rover yet, Perseverance spent the rest of the year exploring Jezero Crater, the site of an ancient lake, collecting rock and soil samples for possible return to Earth and probing for evidence of whether life ever existed on the planet.

                Pandemics eventually end. Three years after COVID burst onto the scene, the world appears to have turned the corner on the first global pandemic in a century. In September, the head of the World Health Organization declared that the end of the pandemic is “in sight.”

               The hype for this technology skyrocketed in 2022 after experimenting with applications with DALL-E or StableDiffusion (an artificial intelligence that draws from descriptive text). This has caused the business sector to invest increasingly in AI. According to an IDC study, investment in this technology will reach 53.5 billion euros in 2023, which represents an increase of 3.4% compared to the previous year.
